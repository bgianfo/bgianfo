Hi, I'm Brian 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

I enjoy collaborating on open source software, giving repositories some ❤️. I'm interested in systems level software in general, debugging and debuggers, databases, operating systems, static and dynamic language analysis, program languages and build systems.

## Projects:
- I maintained the [MSR Detours Package](https://github.com/microsoft/detours) when I was at Microsoft.
- [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) is a hobby OS project I contribute to and previously was a maintainer of. 
- I help maintain Dan Luu's [debugging stories](https://github.com/danluu/debugging-stories) list.
- See below 🙏🏻

## Where to find me:
- It's easy to catch me on email. 
- Writing up something on <a href="https://bjg.io">bjg.io</a> | <a href="https://lab.bjg.io">lab.bjg.io</a>

Feel free to get in contact!
